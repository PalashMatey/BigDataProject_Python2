Advanced Big Data Analytics
Building basic NLTK modules
- Basic Chunking implemented
- Chunking could be used to figure out how many other proper nouns are spoken about 
in Donald Trumps supports.
- Chinking may also be a good resource, but i think i will stick to using Chunks
- Named Entity recongnition completed. Has a very valid use case. Will 
still have to figure out its best use-case application
- Wordnet is a powerful tool to find synonyms and antonymns. Possible use 
case could be to translate words which are in a foreign language. I think 
that the use case viability is limited by the fact that it cant recognise the 
language on its own. (Google translate api could be a better fit)
